## What is it?

In short Eohwiii is a project which goal is to help you learn korean vocabulary.

When learning a new language, learning vocabulary usually is the most tedious part.
Eohwiii was created specially to remedy this issue.

Between an awkward traduction of **어휘** *(korean for vocabulary)* and interactive flashcards, it aims to help you learn quickly and in enjoyable fashion.

In addition, Eohwiii has a really large number of *(mostly relevant)* word collections covering a wide range of subjects with already close to 1800 words.

## How do I use it?

Eohwiii was made to be very straight forward and easy to use:
- chose which subject you want to study
- start learning!
> Be aware that Eohwiii has been created solely for mobile use. Though it can be used on a computer, the experience may not be optimal.

Once you are on Eohwiii's website<sup>[?](https://emmanuelvln.github.io/eohwiii/)</sup> you are welcomed by a first page which allows you to select whatever word collections you wish to study. Select as much as you want, press the **Get started** button and you are good to go.
> I would recommend to start slowly with a subject which suits you. Feel free to take your time and let the words sink in. When you feel like you have mastered this collection, focus on another one and so on. Do not forget to regularly go back to previously studied collections.

The next page you are sent to is the one where you will spend most of your time. A word from the previously selected collections appears and you have to translate it.
> Either it will appear in korean and you must give the english translation, either it will appear in english and you must give the korean translation.

If you know the answer, it will instantly be validated. If not, you can press the **Skip** button to reveal the answer and go to the next word.

## Special thanks

Special thanks to **Study Korean Today**<sup>[?](https://studykoreantoday.com/)</sup> which made this whole project possible by providing a humongous list of vocabulary and its traduction.

## That's all folks!

I hope this project can be of any help to step up your korean game.
Do not hesitate to star this repo if it was ;)
